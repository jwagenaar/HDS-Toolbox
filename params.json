{"name":"HDS-toolbox","body":"The HDS-Toolbox provides an object oriented way to access large quantities of data and meta-data in a structured and intuitive way using Matlab. It offers great flexibility by allowing the user to define a hierarchical structure of class definitions that specify the content of the database. Objects of these classes can be linked using intuitive syntax and accessed in the same way as standard Matlab structures. Although the database handles as a Matlab structure, the toolbox stores each object on disk separately.\r\n\t\r\nThis approach enables the user to create 'virtual' Matlab structures that contain Gigabytes of data without running out of memory. Objects are loaded from disk dynamically, which maximizes access speed while minimizing the memory requirements. \r\n\r\n![HDSCommandLine](http://www.jwagenaar.net/HDSToolbox/images/ShowTreeEx.png)\r\n\r\n### Getting the Toolbox\r\n\r\nYou can download the toolbox by clicking on the download buttons shown on the top of this page. Alternatively, you can fork the project, watch the project for updates and contribute to the project using Github.\r\n\r\nTo use the toolbox, add the HDS-Toolbox and the HDS-Toolbox/Examples folders to the Matlab path. Documentation about the toolbox is available by accessing the Matlab help.\r\n\r\n### Tutorials and Examples\r\nAdditional tutorials and information about the toolbox are located on the wiki page associated with this project: [HDS-Toolbox Wiki](https://github.com/jwagenaar/HDS-Toolbox/wiki)\r\n","tagline":"Hierarchical Data Storage Toolbox for Matlab","google":"UA-32510696-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
